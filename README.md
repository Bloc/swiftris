This repository maintains the completed source code indicative of the project you may build yourself by completing [Bloc's Swiftris book](https://www.bloc.io/swiftris-build-your-first-ios-game-with-swift). If you enjoyed Swiftris and would like to read more Bloc books, check out [Jottly.](https://www.bloc.io/build-your-first-website-with-html-and-css) Bloc's Jottly book teaches you how to build your very first website using HTML, CSS and the Skeleton framework.

## Bloc

At [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/) we offer an [iOS apprenticeship](https://www.bloc.io/iOS) in which a skilled professional will guide you as you learn how to build applications for the iOS platform. Our programs are of variable length and tailored for your budget.

## Swiftris Tech Details

Swiftris is a Tetris clone written entirely in **Swift** which employs **SpriteKit**. It currently builds with Xcode 6.1.1; beta versions of Swift are unsupported.

The organization of this project is as follows:

| **File** | **Purpose** | **Layer** |
| :---: | --- | :---: |
| [`Array2D.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/Array2D.swift) | A custom Array class which supports a `[column, row]` subscript for accessing a grid | Logic |
| [`Block.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/Block.swift) | Defines and represents a single square tile on the game board via column, row and color references | Logic |
| [`Shape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/Shape.swift) | A base class which may represent a Tetromino. This class arranges four `Block` objects in an order defined by its subclasses. It also manages rotation, | Logic |
| [`SquareShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/SquareShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **O** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`LineShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/LineShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **Line** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`SShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/SShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **S** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`ZShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/ZShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **Z** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`LShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/LShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **L** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`JShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/JShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **J** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`TShape.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/TShape.swift) | A subclass of `Shape` which specifies the placement and rotation of the **T** Tetromino | Logic |
| [`Swiftris.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/Swiftris.swift) | This class maintains the game logic. It generates all shapes and tracks level and score | Logic |
| [`GameViewController.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/GameViewController.swift) | The single View Controller responsible for bridging the gap between the `Swiftris` and `GameScene` objects. It also responds to several gestures: swipe, pan and tap. Lastly, it updates the score and level labels | User Interface |
| [`GameScene.swift`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/GameScene.swift) | A subclass of `SKScene` which is responsible for drawing, redrawing and animating all blocks to and from the game board. It also is responsible for sound playback | Visual |
| [`Main.storyboard`](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris/blob/master/Swiftris/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard) | The storyboard provides the view for `GameViewController` in which the score and level labels are defined | Visual |
